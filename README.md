Forecasting Indonesian Non-Oil and Gas Export Values by Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

Developed a Bachelor's Thesis about Gated Recurrent Unit to Forecast Indonesian Non-Oil and Gas Export Values. Several Gated Recurrent Unit models were made—Vanilla GRU and 2 Stacked GRU—with hyperparameter tuning on number of neurons, learning rate, and activation function. The best model shows a MAPE accuracy of 6,78% for training data and 7,41% for testing data.
